# Better Chat for Google Meet
> Beta 2 (no installer gui)

This version has in "chat_client" a Firefox addOn that works on meet.google.com/xxxxx only
    It needs Meet Chat opened to work

In "chat_server" there´s a installer.exe 
It adds a Registry Key in windows to "C:/Users/~~~/appdata/local/better_chat/" 
Adds a better_chat.exe which is called from meet.google.com by a #command written in meet´s chat

>Changes

*Se agregó una pagina de inicio en https://juarezgonz02.github.io/better_chat/ y se cambió la estetica del instalador
